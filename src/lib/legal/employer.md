## 2.PAYMENT TERMS 

By posting a Job Reward, you agree to pay RFFR all Placement Fees and Platofrm Fees (collectively, “**Fees**”) charged by the Job Reward, as follows:

**2.1. Placement Fees.** Employers shall, within seven (7) days after each Successful Placement: (a) notify RFFR of such Successful Placement in writing; and (b) provide RFFR with documentation confirming the applicable Candidate’s compensation; provided, Employers may redact any sensitive information regarding the Candidate from such documentation. If any Employer fails to either notify RFFR in writing or provide such documentation within seven (7) days after a Successful Placement, the Employer agrees that an additional fee equal to five percent (5%) of the applicable Placement Fee shall be added to the invoice for such Successful Placement (the “**Late Fee**”). Employers shall pay the full Placement Fee and any applicable Late Fee to RFFR no later than thirty (30) days after the start date in the Offer (the “**Payment Term**”). Any portion of the Placement Fee or Late Fee that remains unpaid after the Payment Term shall accrue interest at a rate of one and a half percent (1.5%) of the amount owed and interest thereon, or such lesser amount as may be the maximum amount permitted by law, compounded monthly. In addition, Employers agree that (i) if any Late Fee is accrued; and/or (ii) if the Placement Fee is not paid in full during the Payment Term, then any opportunity for a Placement Fee refund will be invalidated in full, as provided below.

**2.2. Third-Party Service Provider.**  RFFR uses Stripe, Inc. (“**Stripe**”) and its affiliates as the third party service provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services) (“**Third-Party Service Provider**”).  By accepting or making payments on any of the Services, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and its Terms of Service (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/us/terms) and hereby consent and authorize RFFR and Stripe to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more Third-Party Service Provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.

## 3. PLACEMENT FEE REFUNDS AND EXEMPTIONS

**3.1. Placement Fee Exemption.**  No Placement Fee will be charged for a Successful Placement if the Employer can establish with sufficient supporting records and documentation that it had a pre-existing evaluation (“**Pre-Existing Evaluation**”) of the relevant Candidate in the twelve (12) months prior to receiving the Candidate’s information through the RFFR Platform. Examples of Pre-Existing Evaluation include any two-way written communication with the Candidate regarding their candidacy or a documented formal interview with the Candidate about a job opportunity. RFFR retains full discretion in determining whether information provided qualifies for a fee exemption per the criteria above.

## 3.2. Placement Fee Refund Requirements

RFFR shall refund an Employer’s Placement Fee in full if the Employer notifies RFFR and the following conditions are met:

(a) Candidate’s employment or consultancy was terminated (by Employer or Candidate) within three (3) months after the start date in the Offer, and the intended term of engagement was not less than three (3) months;

(b) Employer paid the Placement Fee in full within the Payment Term;

(c) No Late Fee was ever accrued; 

(d) Candidate and Employer do not intend to resume (and actually do not resume) the employment or consultancy for at least nine (9) months after the termination date of the employment or consultancy.  In the event that the Candidate and Employer do resume the employment or consultancy within such nine (9) month period, any Placement Fee previously refunded with respect to such Candidate shall become due and payable to RFFR immediately; and

(e) Employer did not, in our sole discretion, violate the Agreement.

## 4. NON-SOLICITATION

During the Addendum Term (as defined below) and for one (1) year thereafter (the “**Non-Solicitation Period**”), an Employer will not, directly or indirectly, condone, assist, or engage in the recruiting, soliciting, encouraging or enticing of any Candidate or Referrer to enter into any employment or independent contractor relationship with an Employer or any other third party outside of, or in circumvention of, the RFFR Platform. Each Employer acknowledges that actual damages may be difficult to ascertain in the event of any breach of the foregoing. Accordingly, if an Employer breaches the foregoing (including by entering into a direct employment or contracting relationship with any Candidate or Referrer during the Non-Solicitation Period) then, for any Candidate hired by Employer, such Employer will pay to RFFR (as liquidated damages and not as a penalty) an amount equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the annual compensation of the Candidate hired. Any such fees owed will be due immediately, but in any event no later than upon the date the Employer or third party enters into a written or oral agreement to hire or engage the services of the Candidate either directly or through a third party.

## 5. TERM AND TERMINATION

**5.1. Addendum Term.** Unless terminated by RFFR, this Addendum will remain in full force and effect while you access or use the RFFR Platform (“**Addendum Term**”).

**5.2. Termination.** We may terminate this Addendum at any time, including if you are suspected of violating any provision of the Agreement. AN EMPLOYER’S OBLIGATION TO PAY (A) ANY UNPAID SUSCRIPTION FEES ACCRUED UP TO THE DATE OF TERMINATION; AND (B) ANY PLACEMENT FEES AND LATE FEES SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS ADDENDUM. All provisions of this Addendum which by their nature are designed to survive termination shall survive any termination or expiration of this Addendum, including any payment terms with respect to the foregoing payment obligations and non-solicitation.
